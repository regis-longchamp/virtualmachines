//The json in this file is used to configure both the static webpage and the VMCreator.fmw workspace.
// For S3ROOT, make sure there is no / at the end of the specified value. A trailing / will break the translation.
//_email_template and _rdp_template look strange here because json doesn't truly support multi-line text
//For _email_template, you only really need to edit the signature at the end of the email
//For _rdp_template, only the username and domain lines might need to be changed, but the current settings are probabaly ok.
//CourseType is the Course tag for the AMI. It should also be the GITBRANCH, and the S3 folder within the bucket.
